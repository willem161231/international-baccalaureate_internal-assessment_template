# Fruit Fanatic

## Problem Question
What fruit should I eat next; I'm bored of normal fruit!
### Project Description
My client is the everyday fruit lover! Anyone who enjoys any kind of fruit is a client in the eyes of Fruit Fanatic. However, if you are a person who enjoys fruit, often you may find yourself thinking, "Well, apples and oranges are great, but I want a change, I need a radical fruit!". Here lies the problem which fruit fanatic seeks to address. The solution? A program which correlates your fruit taste data and gives you a great recommendation on what fruit to eat next!
